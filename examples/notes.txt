The idea with these is that you run `iptables` to set up the rules which block
inbound connections by default, then the `whitelist` script adds more rules to
a separate rule chain which whitelists the IP addresses.

Note that, if you have IPv6, your services may still be exposed through it,
so I wouldn't treat these scripts as more than an example.  For someone like
me who can't be bothered to buy a new router in order to have IPv6, however,
these scripts are all that I need.
