The idea with these is that you would run `iptables` to set up the rules and
then the `whitelist` would add rules to whitelist IP addresses.

Note that, if you have IPv6, your services may still be exposed through it,
so I wouldn't treat these scripts as more than an example.  For someone like
me who can't be bothered to buy a new router in order to have IPv6, however,
these scripts are all that I need.
